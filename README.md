# Setting up Active Directory

## Objective
The primary goal of the "Setting up Active Directory" project is to demonstrate my ability to deploy and configure Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Through this project, I aim to gain a solid understanding of how AD functions, including its architecture and management principles.

Additionally, I intend to expand the functionality of Active Directory by implementing various features. These enhancements will focus on improving user authentication and authorization processes within the IT environment, thus increasing operational efficiency and enhancing the overall user experience.

In summary, the objective of this project is to showcase my proficiency in setting up and managing Active Directory. I aim to leverage this knowledge to contribute to organizational security, streamline administrative tasks, and facilitate smooth user access to resources.
