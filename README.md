# Setting up Active Directory
## Objective
The primary objective of the project "Setting up Active Directory" is to showcase my capability to deploy and configure Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. This endeavor serves as an opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how AD operates at a high level, including its architecture, functionalities, and management principles.

Overall, the objective is not only to demonstrate proficiency in setting up and managing Active Directory but also to leverage this foundational knowledge to enhance organizational security, streamline administrative tasks, and facilitate seamless user access across various resources.
